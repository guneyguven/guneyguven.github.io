Workspace cleanup performed on 2026-02-24

Summary:
- Removed duplicate/unnecessary top-level folders from /Users/guney/Sites/Github
  - Deleted: `Blog` and `guneyguven.com25aralık2025` (and other archives/zip files)
- Kept only: `guneyguven.github.io` at the workspace root
- Verified and pushed branch: `copilot/add-bootstrap-portfolio-setup` to origin
- Re-cloned fresh and verified the branch is up-to-date with origin

How to preview locally (basic steps):
1. Ensure Ruby and Bundler are installed (macOS example):
   - `brew install ruby` (if needed)
   - `gem install bundler`
2. In the repo root, install gems and build the site:
   - `bundle install`
   - `bundle exec jekyll build`
3. To serve locally:
   - `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`

If you want me to run the build or start the dev server, tell me and I'll run it now.
